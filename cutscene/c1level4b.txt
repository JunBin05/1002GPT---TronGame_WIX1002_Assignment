SAME              | CLU | Stability is a constraint of the old world, Flynn. I am building something... efficient.
SAME              | TRON   | Hand over the Shard, CLU. You’re violating your core programming.
SAME              | CLU | My programming is to create the perfect system.

SAME              | SYSTEM | *CLU slams the shard into the pedestal*
c1lightning.gif     | Kevin  | You’re tearing the system apart!

SAME              | SARK   | Command... recognized.
