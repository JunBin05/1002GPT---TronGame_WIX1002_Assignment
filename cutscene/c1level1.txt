SAME                | Kevin  | The Shard of Control.
SAME                | TRON   | It looks... volatile.
SAME                | Kevin  | It’s powerful. It’s the anchor for Grid 2.0.
SAME                | Kevin  | It allows the holder to rewrite the base code in real-time. No more corruption. Pure order.
SAME                | TRON   | That is a dangerous amount of power for one program to hold.
SAME                | Kevin  | That’s why I’m holding it.

c1CLUentrance.gif   | TRON   | CLU. Stand down.
SAME                | CLU    | You built the lock, Creator. But you forgot... I am the key.
